## Getting Started

The first thing you'll need is NodeJS installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After install NodeJS, i strongly recommend you to install Yarn using the command below.

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

After that, you'll need to install Docker. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

Then clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bgarciamoura/mutual-test.git
```

After that, you'll need to install the dependencies. Follow the instructions below.

## Installation

To run this project on your machine, you have to install the dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

Or if you prefer to use NPM, you can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you have to run the command `docker-compose up`. This will start the server and the database. All the dependencies will be installed and the server will be running.

_To stop the server and the database, you can run the command `docker-compose down`._

The default port is 3333.
